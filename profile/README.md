# Welcome to WiiLink!
We're a team of avid tinkers dedicated to reversing channels on the Nintendo Wii.
We specialize in reviving services long discontinued.

## What does WiiLink develop?
Quite a lot, ranging from backends for defunct services to helpful libraries on the Wii! For an up-to-date status page, please see [our website](https://www.wiilink24.com/services).

Our three most developed services are as follows:
| Service       | Backend                                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Wii no Ma     | [room-server](https://github.com/WiiLink24/room-server) |
| Digicam       | [cam-server](https://github.com/WiiLink24/cam-server)   |
| Demae Channel | [food-server](https://github.com/WiiLink24/food-server) |

We additionally have patchers for the contents of these channels themselves, updating things such as URLs, certificates, and region-specific logic.

Some other highly notable libraries developed:
 - [brlytlib](https://github.com/WiiLink24/brlytlib), a Go library for manipulating the BRLYT layout format.
 - [libpatcher](https://github.com/WiiLink24/libpatcher), a C library to apply common IOS patches.
 - [bmgconv](https://github.com/WiiLink24/bmgconv), a Go utility to manipulate the BMG string format.

## How can I get involved?
We appreciate any help - thank you for your interest!
